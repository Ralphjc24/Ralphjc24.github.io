		<h1>The Easy Escape</h1>

		<p>The door shuts close and the loud sound sprungs up the loose metal gate up. Blue waddles with the claking of the cage floor. Jumping out the opening the cage door falls shut behind him.</p>
		
		<p>Turning his head towards the window he flys to it taping on the glass with his peak. Waddling away he stares. Looking down a strange triangle shaped field is below along with a large patch of green. Suddenly an object flys towards the window at high speed, smashing the window as blue chirps loudly flying up and hovering above the broken glass.</p>

		<p>Swooping out the window the cold winds hits his feathers as he sores up to the rooftop and sees the iron bars of construction with other humans standing in small balconies. Hovering downwards Blue encounters the free grey outsider birds. Landing onto a light pole Blue interacts with one named Ada although Blue thinks it sounds strange. Ada speaks of long roads that connect one place to another and a place where humans throw sprinkles of food. Blue feeling hungry flew to that destination.

	    <p>Ariving at a store a man spreads crumps at the floor and Blie looking behind him sees a flock of greys barrage their way to eat. Blue horrified stumbles and tries to pick as much of the fluffy(bread) white goodness as he can before again having to shove and stumble to fly off.</p>

	    <p>Passing through columns of bricks and glass Blue comes upon a large glass object with a bunch of humans around it. Blue astound by it flaps his wings and lands besides it.</p>

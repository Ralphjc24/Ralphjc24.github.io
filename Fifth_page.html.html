		<p>Flying and swooshing left to right trying not get wet but couldn't as the water drops began to multiply. Blue barely able to keep his wings flapping he manages to fly onto a fire escape and stood onto an semi-open window and went inside. One lamp on and the rest of the room was dark with no human insight. Chirping, Blue wiggled off his soaked feathers. Looking around he heard a chirping sound similar to his own come from nearby. Chirping in respond Blue jump and landed next to a square shape covered with a black blanket.</p>

		<p>Blue pecking at the blanket bites it and pulls it away as the chirping became louder from within. Unveiling Blue sees her. Asking her name she replys with Mabel. Conversing for almost an hour Mabel confesses about the outside world beyond the window. Blue responds with his adventures and encounters.</p>

		<h2>A Friend</h2>

		<p>Blue hearing of her struggles and attempts that failed due to her not knowing where else to go once she got out until deciding to go back, Blue hearing this offered help. Configuring the gate both work together to open it, finally getting her out both approach the window. A creaking sound came from behind them as the door open a light shined, walking into the room a human. With swift both fly out the window and fly off as the rain became drizzle and loud yell came out the room saying "wait"!</p>

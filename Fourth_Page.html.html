		<h1>The Green Fields</h1>
			<a href="file:///C:/Users/ralph/Documents/Website_Testing/Third_Page.html"> <-Third Page</a>
		<p>Opening his eyes to the light that he followed the day before Blue spreads his wings and flys upwards countinueing to explore and perhaps find a permanet place. Hovering through the city with the wind blowing behind him. Floating with a sudden grumbling sound Blue flew around looking for anything he can find to eat, to no a vail. Traversing through those small patches of green fields Blue lands next to a wooden chair with a human next to it.</p>

		<h2>The Kind Stranger</h2>

		<p>Looking at the human Blue sees the human reach into his pocket and sprinkles seeds among the dirt path. Similar to the once known human who would feed him. Blue looking how the seeds and dirt mix Blue made a disgruntled face(the human couldn't realize it). Minutes later the human decided to put out his handful of seeds and nervously lend it out to Blue, Blue jump onto his hand and had his breakfeast. Feeling satisfied Blue heard the human say something but couldn't understand so he reply with thanks and flew away.</p>

		<h3>A Missing Piece</h3>

		<p>Hoping forward on a field with a bunch of trees and chirping Blue sees nest after nest of greys paired together with their partner. Looking around and realizes there is no one else like him. Wondering to see if there is someone like him Blue coutinues to roam for more than just a meal. Flying, a single drop of water hits Blue and he tumbles a few inches to the ground, it started to raining.</p>

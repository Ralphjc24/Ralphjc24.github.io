		  <p>Looking at it Blue became mesmerized by his own imagae but became hard to stare due to the amount of humans walking by completely oblivous to him as they all looked at their metal light things on their hands. Blue deciding to flaps his wings and land on top of the huge glass thing. Twitching his head left to right sighting where else to as the small bright light begins to go down. Blue seeing this for the first time ever follows it to see where would the light go.</p>

		  <p>Flying for quite some time Blue starts to feel tired and decides to rest, planting his feet seeing that the light suddenly disappeared and as he twitchs his head to look behind the familiar other bright light shines in the not so-blue-anymore sky.</p>

		  <h2> A Home Maybe?</h2>

		  <p>Roaming around without a clue of where to go with his sore wings Blue goes up a building only the rooftops filed with tons of greys all gather together. No room left Blue looks for some where else to rest on, away from the other greys and giant humans. Blue lays his beady symmetrical eyes on an iron tube on an alley way. Waddling inside it smells but as Blue looks around theres no other option. Closes his eyes and sleeps.</p>

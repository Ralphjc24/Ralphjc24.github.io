		<h1>Baby Blue</h1>
		
			
		<p>Entering an open window into room filled with books from bio to pre-cal a chirp can be heard. Standing at bedside onto a wooden task a blue bird stares at the cracked open window trap in shady black cage.</p>

		<p>Appropriately named blue for it's blue feathers. Blue looks through its cage at the open window viewing the sykscrapers.</p>

		<h2>The Iron Box</h2>
	    <p>Swooping around the box chomping at it's bars, Blue struggles to open the small door that only the weird human who comes once a while can open it. Pausing, Blue stands in the middle chirping while still eyeing at the shut window with huge concrete structures in the far distance.</p>

		<h3>The Human</h3>

		<p>Door slams open as the human wearing glass around her eyes rushes and picks up several books and shoves them into her bag as she bites down a piece of bread thats in a metal warming box. She leaves but dashes back inside towards Blue's cage and rambles something apologetically,picking the feeder and refilling it afterwords running off.</p>
